# Definition of Ready

The **Definition of Ready** (DoR) is a crucial prerequisite in software development that emphasizes preparation and precise criteria. It is a set of conditions that must be met before a task can be accepted into a sprint. DoR is a collaborative effort between the product owner and the development team to ensure that tasks are well-defined and ready to be worked on. 

DoR is a prerequisite for the Definition of Done (DoD), which is a set of conditions that must be met before a task can be considered complete.

## INVEST

DoR follows the INVEST model, emphasizing the following key principles for tasks:

- *Independent*: Tasks are self-contained.
- *Negotiable*: Teams have flexibility in their approach.
- *Valuable*: Tasks deliver meaningful outcomes.
- *Estimable*: Task complexity can be accurately assessed.
- *Small*: Complex tasks are broken down into manageable components.
- *Testable*: Tasks can be verified for successful completion.

## Acceptance Criteria (Given-When-Then)

Structured conditions, actions, and expected results guide task completion and validation. It is based on the format:

- Given &lt;context&gt;, When &lt;action&gt;, then &lt;result&gt;


## Estimation in Story Points

Tasks are estimated on a scale from 0 to 100, facilitating a standardized approach to assess complexity.

This story points were estimated using the **Planning Poker Method**.

### Planning Poker Method

The Planning Poker Method is a consensus-based technique that allows teams to estimate the complexity of a task. It is based on the following steps:

1. Each team member is given a set of cards with numbers representing the complexity of a task.
2. The product owner presents a task to the team.
3. Each team member selects a card that represents their estimate of the task's complexity.
4. The cards are revealed, and the team discusses the estimates.
5. The process is repeated until a consensus is reached.

By integrating these elements, DoR fosters a collaborative environment focused on efficiency, transparency, and timely delivery of high-quality software solutions.
