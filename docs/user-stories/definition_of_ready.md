# Definition of Ready

The **Definition of Ready** (DoR) is a set of conditions that must be met before a user story can be accepted into a sprint. It is a collaborative effort between the product owner and the development team to ensure that user stories are well-defined and ready to be worked on.

In Jira, user stories are assigned a developer that's responsible for them, the number of stories points, and its description refers the added value to the user and the acceptance criteria it should follow.

# Description of the user story

A **user story** is a way to specify the features of a product by focusing on the user's needs and describes it from their point of view. Having the user as the main priority makes new features focused on increasing value for him.

- **As a** <role/user>
- **I want to** <function/functionality>
- **So that** <benefit/value>

## INVEST criteria

- *Independent*: Tasks are self-contained.
- *Negotiable*: Teams have flexibility in their approach.
- *Valuable*: Tasks deliver meaningful outcomes.
- *Estimable*: Task complexity can be accurately assessed.
- *Small*: Complex tasks are broken down into manageable components.
- *Testable*: Tasks can be verified for successful completion.

## Acceptance criteria using GWT

The GWT (Given-When-Then) structure used in writing the acceptance criteria helps us define the behaviour that the user story should have. It is based on specific use scenarios, which are commonly performed during its execution.

- **Given** &lt;pre-condition&gt;
- **When** &lt;action&gt;
- **Then** &lt;result&gt;

## Estimation in story points

Tasks are estimated on a scale from 0 to 100, facilitating a standardized approach to assess complexity. Within the team, story points are estimated using the **Planning Poker Method**, available at https://app.storypoint.poker.

1. Each team member is given a set of cards with numbers representing the complexity of a task.
2. The product owner presents a task to the team.
3. Each team member selects a card that represents their estimate of the task's complexity.
4. The cards are revealed, and the team discusses the estimates.
5. The process is repeated until a consensus is reached.
