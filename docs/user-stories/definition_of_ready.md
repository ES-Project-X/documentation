# Definition of Ready

The **Definition of Ready** (DoR) is a set of conditions that must be met before a user story can be accepted into a sprint. It is a collaborative effort between the product owner and the development team to ensure that user stories are well-defined and ready to be worked on.

## INVEST criteria

- *Independent*: Tasks are self-contained.
- *Negotiable*: Teams have flexibility in their approach.
- *Valuable*: Tasks deliver meaningful outcomes.
- *Estimable*: Task complexity can be accurately assessed.
- *Small*: Complex tasks are broken down into manageable components.
- *Testable*: Tasks can be verified for successful completion.

## Acceptance criteria using GWT

The GWT (Given-When-Then) structure used in writing the acceptance criteria helps us define the behaviour that the user story should have.

- **Given** &lt;pre-condition&gt;
- **When** &lt;action&gt;
- **Then** &lt;result&gt;


## Estimation in story points

Tasks are estimated on a scale from 0 to 100, facilitating a standardized approach to assess complexity. Within the team, story points are estimated using the **Planning Poker Method**, available at https://app.storypoint.poker.

1. Each team member is given a set of cards with numbers representing the complexity of a task.
2. The product owner presents a task to the team.
3. Each team member selects a card that represents their estimate of the task's complexity.
4. The cards are revealed, and the team discusses the estimates.
5. The process is repeated until a consensus is reached.
