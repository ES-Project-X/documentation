# Definition of Done

The **Definition of Done** (DoD) outlines the criteria that must be met for a user story or task to be considered complete. It ensures that all aspects of the development process are meticulously addressed and validated. A comprehensive DoD typically includes the following criteria:

## Tests for User Story

Before considering a user story complete, thorough tests need to be conducted to ensure that the functionality meets the specified requirements and operates as intended.

## Quality Gate (Sonar Way)

The Quality Gate assessment, following the Sonar Way approach, ensures that the code meets specific quality standards, including:

- More than 80% test coverage to guarantee comprehensive testing.
- Less than 3% duplicated lines to promote code efficiency and maintainability.
- "A" grade maintainability and reliability to ensure long-term code sustainability.
- 100% review of security hotspots to eliminate potential vulnerabilities.
- An "A" security rating to signify that the code meets stringent security standards.

## Code Review by Peers

A crucial step in the completion process involves a thorough code review by two randomly assigned peers. This ensures that the code is thoroughly examined, validated, and aligns with the established coding standards and best practices.

## Updated Technical Documentation

The completion of any task or user story mandates that the technical documentation is meticulously updated. This ensures that any changes or updates to the codebase are well-documented, allowing for ease of understanding and maintenance for future developments.

By adhering to these criteria, teams can ensure that every aspect of the development process, including testing, code quality, and documentation, is rigorously evaluated and fulfilled.
