## Sprint Retrospective

**How did you do this sprint?**

- We did almost everything we planned, expect one bigger user story (ES-15).

**What did we do well, that if we donâ€™t discuss we might forget?**

- Changed the definition of done. Unit tests on the Web UI were replaced by Selenium tests and/or manual tests with screenshots.

**What did we learn?**

- Certification of the domain to allow HTTPS.

- Better understanding of the domain model.

**What helps you to be successful as a team?**

- Good communication.

**What should we do differently next time?**

- Start our tasks earlier in the sprint, and not leave it for the end. Better management of the time spent on different courses.

- Make changes in the documentation earlier in the sprint, e.g. definition of done, so that we are all on the same track.

**What still puzzles us?**

- How React tests in Jest work so bad with the map component we are using.

**What is your biggest impediment?**

- Work from other courses.
